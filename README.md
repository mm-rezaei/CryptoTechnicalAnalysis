# Crypto Technical Analysis
Advanced Automated Cryptocurrency Trade Bot


## Introduction
A year ago, after realizing that the trading robots in the marketplace have many weaknesses, I decided to produce a trading robot called Chanel. The robots in the crypto market were often either inefficient, or inaccurate, or did not provide users with a good backtest. Many of them also needed programming knowledge to implement their strategies. Although some of them offer different features to the user for a lot of money, but they were still not usable with all their features. I myself bought two of the best ones before developing this project, but I could not use them due to their many problems. So I decided to develop my current product and make it available to everyone so they can use it if needed. This project went a little slow due to my busy schedule, and besides, I could not complete it. Many of its capabilities have already been completed and many capabilities and improvements can be made for this project. On this page I try to document everything. I will also gradually add all the versions of my local repository to the Github so that those who intend to work on it can fix any possible problems. It is worth mentioning that this project has been developed individually in overtime. I plan to create a product with unique features for the public by creating a group of programmers if funded.
